# Srilasya_Portfolio
Hello,  and welcome to my portfolio. As a data scientist, during my years of experience I have worked on machine learning projects, used various tools and skillsets to address business needs and provided solutions, as well as worked on developing business strategy and providing technical writing for various organizational projects. During my free time, I like to work on my own projects and continue to improve my skills by learning. I also write about my work, projects and experiences. My goal is to create a positive change in society, and strive to bring value in an area that could help the current and future generations. Data is my pathway towards that goal.
