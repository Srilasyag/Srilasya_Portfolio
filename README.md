# Srilasya_Portfolio
Hello,  and welcome to my portfolio. As a data scientist, during my years of experience I have worked on machine learning projects, used various tools and skillsets to address business needs and provided solutions, as well as worked on developing business strategy and providing technical writing for various organizational projects. During my free time, I like to work on my own projects and continue to improve my skills by learning. I also write about my work, projects and experiences. My goal is to create a positive change in society, and strive to bring value in an area that could help the current and future generations. Data is my pathway towards that goal.

# Project 1: Cancer-Detection--Neural-Networks
A dataset cancer was given which has 683 rows and 10 columns(independent variables) : 'Clump Thickness', 'UofCSize', 'UofCShape', 'Marginal Adhesion', 'SECSize', 'Bare Nuclei', 'Bland Chromatin', 'Normal Nucleoli' 'Mitoses', 'Class'.

The dependent variable was the Class of cancer( 2 for benign and 4 for malignant)

An analysis of multi-layer perceptron model of a neural network algorithm was done to develop insights that can be used to create a machine learning model. The following concepts were applied in the exploratory data analysis: key statistics, correlation analysis, Neural network and decision tree analysis and evaluation of the model to determine if it is a good fit to the data.
