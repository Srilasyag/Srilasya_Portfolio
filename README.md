# Srilasya- Data Projects Portfolio
Hello,  and welcome to my portfolio. As a data scientist, during my years of experience I have worked on machine learning projects, used various tools and skillsets to address business needs and provided solutions, as well as worked on developing business strategy and providing technical writing for various organizational projects. During my free time, I like to work on my own projects and continue to improve my skills by learning. I also write about my work, projects and experiences. My goal is to create a positive change in society, and strive to bring value in an area that could help the current and future generations. Data is my pathway towards that goal.

# [Project 1: Cancer-Detection--Neural-Networks](https://github.com/Srilasyag/Cancer-Detection--Neural-Networks)
A dataset cancer was given which has 683 rows and 10 columns(independent variables) : 'Clump Thickness', 'UofCSize', 'UofCShape', 'Marginal Adhesion', 'SECSize', 'Bare Nuclei', 'Bland Chromatin', 'Normal Nucleoli' 'Mitoses', 'Class'.

The dependent variable was the Class of cancer( 2 for benign and 4 for malignant)

An analysis of multi-layer perceptron model of a neural network algorithm was done to develop insights that can be used to create a machine learning model. The following concepts were applied in the exploratory data analysis: key statistics, correlation analysis, Neural network and decision tree analysis and evaluation of the model to determine if it is a good fit to the data.

# [Project 2: Superstore Sales Forecasting Analysis](https://github.com/Srilasyag/Superstore-Walmart-Sales-Forecasting-Analysis)
Every department store chain wants to predict the store sales in the nearby future so that they can plan for inventory.
Sales prediction helps increase/decrease store staff base on the rush.
More sales indicate that there are more customers coming to the store. Sales and revenue forecasting will help to better understand a company’s cash flow and overall growth.
To plan for inventory, it is important to know what products or category of products will be utilized more. Understocking can occur, and sales are affected. Overstock items such as perishables and loss can occur due to loss and product expiry. 
Sales Prediction is done at a combination of store and department level and also at product level for high selling products.
In this project, the sales data includes 45 stores based on store, department, and week. The size and type of each store is provided. Holiday weeks have been marked. Along with this, price markdown data (discount data) has been given. A few macro indicators such as CPI, Unemployment rate, Fuel Price etc. are also provided.

# Project Concepts:

•	Understand the problem Statement clearly and how it is applicable to the scenario of Sales Forecasting.

•	Perform basic EDA to familiarize with the data.

•	Take care of missing values and datatype issues in the data.

•	Understand unique key in different data and Merging the data.

•	Perform Univariate analysis for both numeric and categorical variables.

•	Plot trend of each predictor with target variable 

•	Do an in-depth analysis on the impact of Date/Week on Sales

•	Create new features that might add value to model.

•	Define a function for each set of code that might need to be repeated again. 

•	Prepare the data for modelling.

•	Make prediction using statistical techniques.

•	Make model using machine learning techniques.

•	Create time series ARIMA models and learn to give their parameters.

•	Perform Hyper-parameter tuning to get the best parameters.

•	Learn how to make predictions where data is sparse.

•	Compare the performance of different models using multiple metrics.
